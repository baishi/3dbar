class GrowFill:
    """
    Class which generates floodfilled areas on selected coordinates.
    
    Improvements: 
    
    pon, 17 maj 2010, 19:25:38 CEST
    SVG image after rendering is converted to indexed color and then all
    non-white pixels are converted to color 200.
    
    wto, 8 cze 2010, 14:09:13 CEST
    Removed generating vBrain structure, instead of this inverse of vBrain is traced.
    This procedure allows to generate area with brain ( instead of area of brain inverse)
    which is much more usefull.
    Note: vBrain is traced as first structure - not as last.
    
    sro, 9 cze 2010, 13:45:38 CEST
    Aditional image with brain area is cached after tracing whole brain area. This image is
    used in order to determina if flood fill seed is placed within brain area.
    
    sro, 9 cze 2010, 13:50:10 CEST
    Structure path elements naming scheme: Generic structure name is >>structure%d_%s_%s<<
    where consecutive variables are:

        1. Subsequent structure number
        2. ID of the label basing on which given path was created
        3. Name of the structure modeled with given path
    
    Examples of valid path IDs:

        - structure92_label102_st
        - structure116_label131_Xi
        - structure1_label1_CPu
    
    When number of path doesn't match with number of label it means that tracing of some
    structures was ommited due to placing seed in non-white pixels.
    
    sro, 9 cze 2010, 15:14:25 CEST
    Skipping tracing spotlabels and comment labels. 
    
    czw, 10 cze 2010, 16:32:41 CEST
    Replaced floodfilling alogrithm:
    Instead of currently used PIL ImageDraw.floodfill algorithm, the custom
    algorithm floodFillScanlineStack (implemented by me basing on http://) is
    now used. 
    
    The new algorithm appeared to be twice as fast as the previous algorithm.
    However, due to different method of performing filling the results of both
    algorithms are not exactly the same. The scanline algorithm seems to flood
    larger number of pixels than default algotithm. Neverless, the differences
    as rather slight and there is no need for further changes in the code.
    
    Corrected brain contour treshold bug.
    In order to determine if structure labels are paced inside the brain regions
    the whole brain is traced in first step. Then brain region is cached for
    further comparision. However no treshold was applied and gray lines were not
    removed which produced unnecesarry errors. After applying treshold, all
    gray pixels where changed to white so the bug was removed. 

    Fri Jun 11 10:48:22 CEST 2010
    List of reviewing and error tracing procedures:

        1. When seed is placed outside brain region, warning is generated and
           debug information is dumped. Structure is not traced.
        2. When seed in placed on border (in non-white pixel in general),
           warning is generated and debug information is stored. Structure is not
           traced.
        3. Path naming scheme is constructed in a way which allows to quickly
           determine if tracing process was fully correct or not. Paths has to be
           numerated with consecutive numbers consistent with ID of corresponding
           labels.
        4. Spot labels and comment labels are not traced.
        5. For each step of processing, debug information may be stored. By debug
           information I mean SVG files with single traced structures as well as
           bitmaps from intermediate steps of processing

    
    pia, 2 lip 2010, 12:21:14 CEST
    Implementing unlabeled structures handling.
    Assumptions:

        1. Areas with are not covered by regular labels are to be found and denoted
           as unlabelled areas.
        2. For each unlabelled area path and corresponding label should be created.
        3. Labels denoting unlabelled areas are backpropagated to pretraced file
        4. Labels denoting unlabelled areas are not traced - finding unalbelled areas
           is performed from scratch each time.

    Renember that brain contour bitmap has only two colors (black and white).
    Black clolor denotes region outside brain while white color denotes brain area.
    There is no contour in that bitmap. In case when many adjacent unlabeled regions
    exist they will be presented as a single unlabeled area.

        1. Rebuilded path parsing. Now path parsing functions are moved to svgpathparse

    Ie. if cacheLevel=4, there would be 5 images chached - first would be the

    (width, height)

    in order to make the image suitable for tracing. In this list one should put
    text, rect, line, arc, etc. and all other unnecesarry elements.

    ReferenceWidth, ReferenceHeight: (Integer): Width and height of
    non-rasterized SVG image

    GrowDefaultBoundaryColor: Integer from range of (0-255)
    GrowDefaultBoundaryColor: Color for which all boundary pixels will be converted

    MinFiterTimesApplication: (Integer) PIL Min filter parameter -
    very important for  boundary growing procedure.

    PotraceAccuracyParameter, PotraceSVGResolutionString,
    PotraceWidthString, PotraceHeightString: PoTrace configuration options.
    For further details, read PoTrace manual.

    DumpEachStepSVG, DumpEachStepPNG: (boolen) Save SVG/PNG files for every structure?
    DumpDebugInformation: (boolean) Print information about currently traced structure with

    SetDebugDumpOutputDirectory: (string) Directory in which debuging information
