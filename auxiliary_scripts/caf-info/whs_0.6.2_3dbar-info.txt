This model was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated
to reconstructing three-dimensional reconstruction from 2D slides.

This CAF dataset is based on:
Waxholm Space: An image based reference for coordinating research in the mouse
brain.  G. Allan Johnson, Alexandra Badea, Jeffrey Brandenburg, Gary Cofer, Boma
Fubara, Song Liu, Jonathan Nissanov NeuroImage 53 (2) 365-372, 2010 .  The
source dataset is available at
http://civmvoxport.duhs.duke.edu/voxbase/downloaddataset.php?stackID=20494

The delineations were adopted from MBAT-ready Labeled Atlas v0.6.2 containing
label volume with 50 manually segmented brain regions and criteria for delineations,
version 0.6.2 (2012):
http://software.incf.org/software/waxholm-space/waxholm-space/mbat-ready-label-volume-v0.6.2/file_download?file_field=file
Version dated on 19 Oct 2012 was used.

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
