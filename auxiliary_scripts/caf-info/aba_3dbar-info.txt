This model was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated to reconstructing three-dimensional reconstruction from 2D slides.

Reconstruction is based on The Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas available at
http://mouse.brain-map.org/atlas/index.html.

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters). Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

Supported by an infrastructural grant from the Polish Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
