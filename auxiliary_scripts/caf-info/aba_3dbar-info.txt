This dataset was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated
for creating three-dimensional reconstructions from 2D slides.

Reconstruction is based on The Allen Brain Atlas Resources [Internet]. Seattle
(WA): Allen Institute for Brain Science. (C) 2009. Available from:
http://www.brain-map.org.

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

Visit http://www.3dbar.org for more information about the software and relase
notifications. Project is supported by an infrastructural grant from the Polish
Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
