This model was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated
to reconstructing three-dimensional reconstruction from 2D slides.

This CAF dataset is based on:
http://civmvoxport.duhs.duke.edu/voxbase/downloaddataset.php?stackID=20494
Symmetrical Waxholm Space - A symmetrical Waxholm canonical mouse brain for
NeuroMaps.  Bowden DM, et. al., J Neurosci Methods. 2011 Feb 15;195(2):170-5.
The source dataset is available at
http://civmvoxport.duhs.duke.edu/voxbase/downloaddataset.php?stackID=20494

The original Waxholm Space is introduced in Waxholm Space: An image based
reference for coordinating research in the mouse brain.  G. Allan Johnson,
Alexandra Badea, Jeffrey Brandenburg, Gary Cofer, Boma Fubara, Song Liu,
Jonathan Nissanov NeuroImage 53 (2) 365-372, 2010 .

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
