This model was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated to reconstructing three-dimensional reconstruction from 2D slides.

Reconstruction and structure hierarchy is based on the Waxholm Space Atlas available via INCF website athttp://software.incf.org/software/waxholm-space/waxholm-space/LabeledAtlas0.5.1/file_download?file_field=file

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters). Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).
