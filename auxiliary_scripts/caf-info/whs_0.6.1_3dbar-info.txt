This model was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated
to reconstructing three-dimensional reconstruction from 2D slides.

This CAF dataset is based on:
Waxholm Space: An image based reference for coordinating research in the mouse
brain.  G. Allan Johnson, Alexandra Badea, Jeffrey Brandenburg, Gary Cofer, Boma
Fubara, Song Liu, Jonathan Nissanov NeuroImage 53 (2) 365-372, 2010 .  The
source dataset is available at
http://civmvoxport.duhs.duke.edu/voxbase/downloaddataset.php?stackID=20494

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

Visit http://www.3dbar.org for more information about the software and relase
notifications. Project is supported by an infrastructural grant from the Polish
Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
