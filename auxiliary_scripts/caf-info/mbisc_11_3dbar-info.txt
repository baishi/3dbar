This dataset was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated
for creating three-dimensional reconstructions from 2D slides.

Reconstructions are based on  delineations of cortical structures from the The Marmoset Brain in Stereotactic Coordinates atlas by: George Paxinos, Michael Petrides, Charles Watson, Marcello Rosa, Hironobu Tokuno; Publisher: Academic Press.

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

notifications. Project is supported by an infrastructural grant from the Polish
Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
