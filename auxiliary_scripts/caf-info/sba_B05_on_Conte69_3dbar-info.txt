This dataset was created using 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor â€“ software dedicated
for creating three-dimensional reconstructions from 2D slides.

Reconstruction is based on ScalableBrainAtlas B05_on_Conte69 template available
at http://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/main/coronal3d.php?template=B05_on_Conte69
which contains the Brodmann regions projected onto the Conte69 surface, and then
turned into volume data by assuming 3mm uniform cortical thickness. Brodmann
cytoarchitectonic areas (Brodmann 1909). Registered to atlas by visual alignment
of sulcal/gyral landmarks, using Brodmann's lateral and medial views (cf.
Polyak, 1957).  

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

notifications. Project is supported by an infrastructural grant from the Polish
Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
