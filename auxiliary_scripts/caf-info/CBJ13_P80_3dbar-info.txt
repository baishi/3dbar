Allan Johnson (2013) "A quantitative magnetic resonance histology atlas of postnatal rat brain development with regional estimates of growth and variability.", Neuroimage 71:196-206. 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.01.017.

=== 3d Brain Atlas Reconstructor ===

Offline version of 3dBAR allows customizable generation of three-dimensional
structures (ie. with different resolutions or various mesh processing filters).
Final reconstructions may be exported as polygonal meshes (VRML, X3D) as well as
volumetric data (NIfTI, vtk).

Visit http://www.3dbar.org for more information about the software and relase
notifications. Project is supported by an infrastructural grant from the Polish
Ministry of Regional Development, POIG.02.03.00-00-003/09.
